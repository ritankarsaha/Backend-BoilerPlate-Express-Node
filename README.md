# PREVIEW

This is a backend boilerplate code for developers using the MERN stack. The frontend can be of any framework. The backend is robust and built on Express and Node.js.

## Important Features of the Boilerplate:
- The backend is built on top of Express.js and Node.js.
- **Multer** has been used for file uploads.
- **Dot-env** for safe-keeping environment variables during development.
- **Bcrypt** has been used for hashing (encrypting) and decrypting passwords.
- **Cloudinary** is being used for data uploads.
- **JWT** for authentication.
- **Cookie-parser** for efficient cookie handling.
- **Mongoose** for schema, models, and MongoDB URI connection.
- **Nodemon** has been used so that the server automatically restarts with any changes.


The code also contains an extra model called video.model.js to show the interconnection between user.model.js and video.model.js. More models are yet to be added to demonstrate the aggregate sub pipelines. They can be reused effeciently later. However it will be on a different branch of a project -aggregate-pipelines.


## Testing:
All route testing has been done through Postman. Each route has properly defined controllers and contains reusable code, making your application ready to go. You just need to add the frontend and make necessary changes according to your needs. You can watch the videos on this YouTube channel to get a clearer idea of API Testing via Postman:

The code is completely open-source. Open a PR if you want to fix something or add anything else. Healthy collaboration is always appreciated.
